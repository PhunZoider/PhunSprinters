description=Other Settings:
description=[list]
description=[*][b]Display Moodle[/b]: Requires MoodleFramework. Shows your current sprinter risk as an on-screen moodle or try the new phunsprintersui mod
description=[*][b]Moodle only when at risk[/b]: Hides the moodle unless there’s a chance of sprinters.
description=[*][b]Percentage Sprinters Volume[/b]: Adjusts how loud their screams are. Some scream audio is... lovingly cursed.
description=[*][b]Darkness Level[/b]: Threshold for global ambient light before sprinting is triggered.
description=[*][b]Slow In Light[b] Makes a sprinter start walking if it gets too bright (eg player shines a flashlight on them). There are some limitations here to minimise performance impact. 
description=[*][b]Skeletons[/b]: Makes sprinters appear as skeletons — helpful for identification even if not sprinting.
description=[*][b]Decorate[/b]: Adds themed outfits to sprinters (e.g., Santa hats at Christmas), depending on mods like Authentic Z and time of year.
description=[*][b]Night Only[/b]: Sprinting only occurs between dusk and dawn, regardless of light level.
description=[*][b]Moon Phase *[/b]: Adjust sprinter risk by moon phase. E.g., 50 halves the risk, 200 doubles it.
description=[*][b]Hours Discount[/b]: Eases in new players. Reduces risk for early-game hours. (e.g., 24 hours = no discount after day one).
description=[*][b]Min/Max Distance[/b]: Controls how close zeds must be to process sprint logic - tuned to target just off-screen.
description=[*][b]Queue Size[/b]: How many zombies are processed per tick. A buffer to smooth lag spikes in dense areas.
description=[*][b]Version Key[/b]: Resets all internal state when changed. You probably won’t need this - it’s a dev fallback.
description=[*][b]Debug[/b]: Enables verbose console logging. Useful when running in debug mode.

description=PhunSprintersUI mod - add "phunsprintersui" to your mod list to enable new experimental UI indicators that aim to inform the user better than the current moodles.
description=[list]
description=[*][b]Elements[/b]: Enables auto display of the new UI widgets. If ticked, they will always be shown
description=[*][b]Lootable bands[/b]: Adds a UV sensor band to loot tables. It Elements is off and this is on, then the elements are only shown when the UV Sensor band is worn
description=[*][b]RNC Integration[/b]: Ticking this box when you have [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2781963981]Rewarding Night Combat[/url] installed and the RNC tooltip that appears in its moon indicator will be incorporated into the moon element tooltip so you could disable their indicator which could overlap with this one
description=[*][b]Layout[/b]: Horizontal or vertical options
