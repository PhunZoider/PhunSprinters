description=This mod requires [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3388867450]PhunZone[/url][/b] and [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=3411695932]PhunLib[/url][/b]. For an on-screen risk indicator, the [b]MoodleFramework[/b] mod is strongly recommended (B41 version [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2859296947]here[/url], B42 version [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3396446795]here[/url]).

description=Other Settings:
description=[list]
description=[*][b]Display Moodle[/b]: Requires MoodleFramework. Shows your current sprinter risk as an on-screen moodle.
description=[*][b]Moodle only when at risk[/b]: Hides the moodle unless there’s a chance of sprinters.
description=[*][b]Percentage Sprinters Volume[/b]: Adjusts how loud their screams are. Some scream audio is... lovingly cursed.
description=[*][b]Darkness Level[/b]: Threshold for ambient light before sprinting is triggered.
description=[*][b]Skeletons[/b]: Makes sprinters appear as skeletons — helpful for identification even if not sprinting.
description=[*][b]Decorate[/b]: Adds themed outfits to sprinters (e.g., Santa hats at Christmas), depending on mods like Authentic Z and time of year.
description=[*][b]Night Only[/b]: Sprinting only occurs between dusk and dawn, regardless of light level.
description=[*][b]Moon Phase *[/b]: Adjust sprinter risk by moon phase. E.g., 50 halves the risk, 200 doubles it.
description=[*][b]Hours Discount[/b]: Eases in new players. Reduces risk for early-game hours. (e.g., 24 hours = no discount after day one).
description=[*][b]Min/Max Distance[/b]: Controls how close zeds must be to process sprint logic - tuned to target just off-screen.
description=[*][b]Queue Size[/b]: How many zombies are processed per tick. A buffer to smooth lag spikes in dense areas.
description=[*][b]Version Key[/b]: Resets all internal state when changed. You probably won’t need this - it’s a dev fallback.
description=[*][b]Debug[/b]: Enables verbose console logging. Useful when running in debug mode.
