description=This mod requires [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3388867450]PhunZones[/url][/b] and [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=3411695932]PhunLib[/url][/b]. For an on-screen risk indicator, use [b]phunsprintersui[/b] (the preferred method) or the [b]MoodleFramework[/b] (B41 version [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2859296947]here[/url], B42 version [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3396446795]here[/url]).

description=[H1]Quick Start[/H1]
description=[list]
description=[*]Click the [b]PhunZones[/b] button in your admin or debug menu
description=[*]Select the [b]- Default - [/b] zone (first on the drop down list) and click "Edit Region"
description=[*][list]Set values for:
description=[*][b]Sprinter Risk %[/b]: The % risk of a player spawning sprinters in this area. eg 10 will mean that by default (and before any adjustments), 10% of zeds in area will be sprinters (though they may not be sprinting yet depending on your other settings)
description=[*][b]Cap Sprinter Risk %[/b]: The maximum chance sprinters will spawn.[/list]

description=Global Settings. Note some of these require a restart to take effect:
description=[table]
description=[tr][th]Setting[/th][th]Description[/th][/tr]
description=[tr][td][b]Display Moodle[/b][/td][td](deprecated, use phunsprintersui instead). Shows your current sprinter risk as an on-screen moodle. Requires the MoodleFramework mod[/td][/tr]
description=[tr][td][b]Moodle only when at risk[/b][/td][td]Hides the moodle unless there is a chance of sprinters[/td][/tr]
description=[tr][td][b]Percentage Sprinters Volume[/b][/td][td]Adjusts how loud their screams are. Some scream audio is... lovingly cursed.[/td][/tr]
description=[tr][td][b]Darkness Level[/b][/td][td]Threshold for global ambient light before sprinting is triggered. The higher this value, the lighter it can be to make sprinters run[/td][/tr]
description=[tr][td][b]Slow In Light[/b][/td][td]Makes a sprinter start walking if it gets too bright (eg player shines a flashlight on them). There are some limitations here to minimise performance impact.[/td][/tr]
description=[tr][td][b]Skeletons[/b][/td][td]Makes sprinters appear as skeletons, helpful for identification even if not sprinting[/td][/tr]
description=[tr][td][b]Decorate[/b][/td][td]Adds themed outfits to sprinters (e.g., Santa hats at Christmas), depending on mods like Authentic Z and time of year.[/td][/tr]
description=[tr][td][b]Night Only[/b][/td][td]If ticked, it won't matter how dark it gets during the day, sprinters will only sprint between Dusk and Dawn (adjust these values in the PhunLib settings)[/td][/tr]
description=[tr][td][b]Moon Phase *[/b][/td][td]Adjust sprinter risk by moon phase. E.g., 50 halves the risk, 200 doubles it.[/td][/tr]
description=[tr][td][b]Hours Discount[/b][/td][td]The number of hours before the risk is fully applied. This is designed to ease in new players. eg If the risk level is 40% and this value is set to 10, it will take 10 hours of playtime for the full 40% to be applied. After 1 hour, the rate would be 4%. At 5 hours the rate would be 20%, etc...[/td][/tr]
description=[tr][td][b]Min/Max Distance[/b][/td][td]Controls how close zeds must be to the player to check if they could be a sprinter. This is to prevent "popping" in of sprinters and to reduce lag (only processing those zeds just "outside" of the players screen)[/td][/tr]
description=[tr][td][b]Queue Size[/b][/td][td]How many zombies are processed per tick. A buffer to smooth lag spikes in dense areas[/td][/tr]
description=[tr][td][b]Version Key[/b][/td][td]Resets all internal state when changed. You probably won’t need this - it’s a dev/debugging tool.[/td][/tr]
description=[tr][td][b]Debug[/b][/td][td]Enables verbose console logging. Useful when running in debug mode.[/td][/tr]

description=PhunSprintersUI mod - add "phunsprintersui" to your mod list to enable new UI indicators that aim to inform the user better than the current moodles.
description=[table]
description=[tr][th]Setting[/th][th]Description[/th][/tr]
description=[tr][td][b]Elements[/b][/td][td]Enables auto display of the new UI widgets. If ticked, they will always be shown[/td][/tr]
description=[tr][td][b]Lootable bands[/b][/td][td]Adds a UV sensor band to loot tables. It Elements is off and this is on, then the elements are only shown when the UV Sensor band is worn[/td][/tr]
description=[tr][td][b]RNC Integration[/b][/td][td]Ticking this box when you have [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2781963981]Rewarding Night Combat[/url] installed and the RNC tooltip that appears in its moon indicator will be incorporated into the moon element tooltip so you could disable their indicator which could overlap with this one[/td][/tr]
description=[tr][td][b]Layout[/b][/td][td]Horizontal or vertical options (I think horizontal is the best!)[/td][/tr]
